# FM2002 Unpacker
This was originally a project to allow playing Fighter Maker 2002 games on the Wii. I, however, despaired at the thought of
rewriting an entire game engine, so I gave up and made the data extraction part stand-alone. Hopefully, someone will make
use of this somehow.

# Credits
- The PySimpleGUI team, for allowing me to easily make a GUI, and for making the PSGCompiler
which allowed me to turn it into an exe (so people don't need Python to run it)
- hlwz5735, for making the 2D Fighter Maker Explorer, a great resource on file formats (https://github.com/hlwz5735/2dfm-exporter)
- Alethila, for making FM2Kunlock.exe, and for saving me immense amounts of time by making sprite_sound_ripper.exe
- Enterbrain, for making Fighter Maker 2002, and Alethila again, for translating it
